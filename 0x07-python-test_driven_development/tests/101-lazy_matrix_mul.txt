VALID m_a AND m_b THAT CAN BE MULTIPLIED
=========================================
The ``lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)`` returns the multiplication of the 2 matrix m_a and m_b when they are valid arguments.

::
	>>> mul = __import__("101-lazy_matrix_mul").lazy_matrix_mul
	>>> ma = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> mb = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> mul(ma,mb)
	array([[7, 10],
	    [15, 22]])
	>>> ma = [[1, 2]]
	>>> mb = [[3, 4], [5, 6]]
	>>> mul(ma,mb)
	array([[13, 16]])
	>>> ma = [[4, 6]]
	>>> mb = [[3], [4]]
	>>> mul(ma,mb)
	array([[36]])
	>>> ma = [[3]]
	>>> mb = [[5]]
	>>> mul(ma,mb)
	array([[15]])
